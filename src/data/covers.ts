      descript: "When ChatGPT-3.5 came out on November 30, 2022, it was the first time that AI impressed us by its human-like text. It can help with answering questions, writing essays, creating content, tutoring in various subjects, and even having casual conversations. Each version has improved in terms of understanding context, handling more complex queries, and generating more accurate and relevant responses. In short, ChatGPT is like having a smart, versatile assistant right at your fingertips."

      descript: "This image represents a tesseract, a 4-dimensional hypercube. While we can’t see the 4th dimension, this image gives us a 3D “shadow” of it—like shining a flashlight on a cube to cast a 2D shadow of two squares, with one smaller inside the other. Here, a tesseract appears as a cube within a cube, connected at the corners. In 4D space, both cubes are actually the same size, with the connecting lines representing higher-dimensional relationships."
