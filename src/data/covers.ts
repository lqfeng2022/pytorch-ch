      descript: "When ChatGPT-3.5 came out on November 30, 2022, it was the first time that AI impressed us by its human-like text. It can help with answering questions, writing essays, creating content, tutoring in various subjects, and even having casual conversations. Each version has improved in terms of understanding context, handling more complex queries, and generating more accurate and relevant responses. In short, ChatGPT is like having a smart, versatile assistant right at your fingertips."

After that, I'll introduce you to some of the most useful Machine Learning frameworks and libraries. For beginners, PyTorch stands out as a powerful and user-friendly framework, so we'll be using PyTorch to build our next projects."

But don't worry if you're not up to speed on Python yet, I've got another course that covers it, and it's pretty straightforward. I'm confident you'll pick it up quickly."
