    description: "When ChatGPT-3.5 came out on November 30, 2022, it was the first time that AI impressed us by its human-like text. It can help with answering questions, writing essays, creating content, tutoring in various subjects, and even having casual conversations. Each version has improved in terms of understanding context, handling more complex queries, and generating more accurate and relevant responses. In short, ChatGPT is like having a smart, versatile assistant right at your fingertips."

    description: "This image represents a tesseract, a 4-dimensional hypercube. While we can't see the 4th dimension, this image gives us a 3D shadow. You can image a 4D flashlight shining onto our 3D space, and the tesseract positioned in the middle. similar to how a light casts a shadow of a 3D cube onto a 2D surface—resulting in two squares, one inside the other. In this image, the tesseract appears as a cube within a cube, connected at the corners. In 4D space, both cubes are actually the same size, with the connecting lines representing higher-dimensional relationships."

    description: "This drawing is all about straight lines creating a cool, spiraling pattern. It’s like a bunch of triangles and angles that pull you in towards the center. Even though it’s just straight lines, they come together in a way that feels almost like it’s moving or shifting as you look at it. It’s a great example of how straight lines can be used to create something that feels dynamic and alive, despite their rigid and orderly nature."

    description: "This graph is a powerful visualization of how Gradient Descent operates when two parameters are involved. It shows the path the algorithm takes across the parameter space (θ₁ and θ₂) to minimize the loss function - Loss(θ₁,θ₂). The movement along the surface illustrates how the parameters are iteratively adjusted to reduce the loss, eventually converging to a point where the model is optimally trained."

Here this neural network is pretty simple, which has only one hidden layer with fully connected feed-forward. In last chapter, we built a neural network with this kind of simple architecure, here in this chapter, we'll talk about it deeper, especially the backpropagation, - a core algrithm behind neural networ."
