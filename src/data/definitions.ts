If you tried to build this program using traditional programming techniques, it would quickly become overly complicated. You'd need to create a ton of rules to account for specific curves, edges, colors, ear shapes, and other features to distinguish between a cat and a dog. And if I handed you a black-and-white photo, those rules might not work, so you'd have to rewrite them. Or if the image was taken from a different angle, your program might struggle to identify it correctly. So, trying to solve this problem with traditional programming would be not only complex but potentially impossible in some cases."

After training, we can show the model a new picture of a cat or a dog that it hasn't seen before and ask it whether it's a cat or a dog. The model will then give us an answer with a certain level of accuracy. The more data we provide, the more accurate the model becomes."

In the initial layers, it might detect basic patterns like edges. As the data passes through more layers, the network learns to recognize more complex features like ear shapes, eventually distinguishing between cats and dogs on its own."
